# Graphs
Graphs are non-linear data structures that do not necessarily follow a numerical order. Graphs are similar to trees but with essentially no rules. A tree is a graph, but most graphs are not trees.

     A –→ B ←–––– C → D ↔ E
     ↑    ↕     ↙ ↑     ↘
     F –→ G → H ← I ––––→ J
           ↓     ↘ ↑

Graphs have nodes (also called verticies) and edges. The node holds the data and then the edges point to related nodes. There are two types of edges: directed and undirected. Directed edges point in a direction whereas undirected edges point both ways. 

* Good examples of graphs are Facebook friends, Twitter following (which would be directed), or a map of Metro stops.

* There are many ways to store a graph data structure. You can use pointers and nodes, or you could use an adjacency list or matrix.

* A degree is how many edges a given vertex has. 

* An Euler path visits each edge just once. A graph must have either zero or two verticies with an odd degree to have an euler path. 

* A cycle is a circle mad of edges.

* Both edges and nodes can be weighted.
