# Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees are a special form of [tree data structure](https://github.com/aspittel/coding_cheat_sheets/blob/master/data_structures/trees.md) where each left child of a node has a lower value than its parent and each right child has a greater value than its parent. These are very efficient for searching.
