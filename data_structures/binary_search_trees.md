# Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees are a special form of [tree data structure](https://github.com/aspittel/coding_cheat_sheets/blob/master/data_structures/trees.md) where each left child of a node has a lower value than its parent and each right child has a greater value than its parent. There cannot be any duplicate values in the tree. These are very efficient for searching. 

|Operation|Complexity|

|Access   |O(log n)  |
|Search   |O(log n)  |
|Insert   |O(log n)  |
|Delete   |O(log n)  |
